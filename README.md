🚀 AI-Resume-Parser-Analysis

📌 Overview

This Project is focuses on AI-powered application that analyzes resumes, predicts job roles, and stores results in an SQLite database. Built with **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn**, this project provides a simple yet effective way to parse, analyze, and manage resumes.  

 🚀 Features
- Extracts text from resumes (PDF/DOCX).  
- Predicts job roles using Machine Learning.  
- Stores and manages predictions in SQLite.  
- User-friendly **Streamlit UI**.  
- Option to delete or manage past predictions.  

 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- scikit-learn 
- SQLite
- pandas, PyMuPDF, python-docx
